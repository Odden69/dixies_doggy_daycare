            <h2>This is Dixie's Doggy Daycare</h2>
            <p>Dixie's is a small-scale daycare centre situated on the outskirts of Swindon.
                There are several access roads which make it easy for you to get here by car or public transportation.
                Several parks, where we spend a lot of time, are within walking distance.
                <br>We have a limit of maximum fifteen enrolled dogs.
                Therefore the staff knows all the dogs personalities and your dog will be
                surrounded by professionals who can meet it's special needs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="left about-text-container">

            <p class="about-text"> Being at a doggy daycare should also be fun!
                Once your dog has been schooled at Dixie’s we soon find out who his/her best furry friends are.
                From that day on your dog gets supervised playtime with a good friend every day.</p>
