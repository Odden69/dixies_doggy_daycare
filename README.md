A visitor at the website will find a description of the day care centre, links to the daycare's social media pages, opening hours and prizes and also the centre's adress and phone number.

The footer gives the owner a possibility to send the user on to other medias to provide other aspects of the centre. It also ensures that the correct address and phone number always is available to the reader.

#### Change Schedule Function
This feature meets a daycare centre customer's need to be able to easily make changes to his or her daycare schedule. When you wake up sick, the last thing you want to do is to start calling everyone who needs to know about the situation. Now there is one less call to make. Just go to the website and make a note in the form and that is taken care of.  
When the form has been filled out another note pops up to confirm the submission.

This feature also benefits the owner who doesn't have to guard the phone in the mornings but instead allowing her to spend time with the dogs present.

#### About Us Page
The about us page contains a description of the daycare centre which goal is to ensure the reader of the centres qualities. It's intention is to give the reader a feeling that this small-scale daycare centre is flexible and competent and therefore capable of meeting every dog's needs.  
![About Us Page](assets/images/readme_images/about_us.png)  

On this page the reader also can find opening hours and prizes.
The about us page gives the owner an opportunity to present the daycare centres capacity in a way that she finds relevant.

#### Apply Here Page
On the apply here page an interested dog owner can fill out a form to make a preliminary application to the daycare center. The form contains relevant information to the daycare owner and is a base for the discussions in a future contact. Some of the fields are required and some are not where the required ones are marked with an asterix.  
![Application Form](assets/images/readme_images/apply_form.png)  
When the form has been filled out the user is sent to a thank you page described in the next chapter.  

The big logo provides a link back to the home page.  

The decision to make the page look like it does, without header and footer, was based on esthetic grounds and the fact that leaving out header and footer on a sign up page is very common on the web today.

#### Thank You Page
This page is only viewed as a result of submitting the application form on the apply here page. It gives the user a confirmation of the submission and sends a positive message from the daycare centre.  
The thank you page has the same header and footer as the home page to let the user easily find the way back to the rest of the site.

### Features Left to Implement
These are some features I would love to add to the site in the future:
- A calendar for the owner to post upcoming events in a more structured way with links to sign up pages for the events.
- A FAQ section.
- A page or section with references from present and past customers.  
Even further in the future there might be possible to add a more advanced communication tool where the customers have a log in and, among other things, can see posted pictures of their dog's day.

## Credits
First of all I want to thank my Mentor, Maria Hynes, who has supported me through the project with lots of valuable advice and xxx
The Tutors at Code Institue were there when I ran my head into the wall and needed guidence.
A really big thank you to all my fellow slackers who are always there and ready to listen and support, weather I am having a technical issue or just a need for mental support.
I really don't want to mention anyone specific in case i miss someone but I do have to mention "Team Noiseland", the amazing team I joined the 2021 Retro Gaming Hackathon of Code Institute with. The members have taken a lot of time to review and comment the project.

### Code
A lot of inspiration to the coding was taken from "The coders coffeehouse" and "Love running" which are projects included in the course at Code Institute.
To read more about different elements and attributes I ended up on mainly two pages: w3school and css-trick.com

- The code for the Popup forms was taken from [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_popup_form.asp), even if I had to make quite a lot of adjustments to make it work in this case.
- The code for the Back to Top button was taken from [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp) and was used almost unchanged.
